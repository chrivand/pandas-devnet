# Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
In the previous step, you had an introduction about the dataset and about Pandas. In this step, we are going to play around with the dataset and learn how to use Pandas.

## Objectives

In this lab you will learn how to import a dataset with Python and how to create a DataFrame using Pandas. After this lab, you should be able to:

* Import a dataset with Python
* Create a DataFrame using Python
* Inspect the DataFrame using the built-in method `head()` and `tail()`


## Let's start with writing our code

> **Note**: there is a `pandas_exercise.py` file that contains all of the code. You will be able to use this file to execute. The steps below are there to explain how you would write this yourself, and what the pieces of code do. For the purpose of the lab you can either write your own code, or use the `pandas_exercise.py` file.

1. First, we have to import `pandas`. It is customary to shorten `pandas` to `pd`.

      ```python
      import pandas as pd
      ```

2. Next, we have to read the file and create it into a DataFrame. Fortunately, pandas has a built-in method for reading CSV and JSON files. 

      ```python
      df = pd.read_json(abs_file_path_json) #json file
      df = pd.read_csv(abs_file_path_csv) #csv file
      ```

3. In the last step, we always inspect our DataFrame. Usually, we look at either the first or last five rows of the DataFrame. Review the code to do that below:

    ```python
    df.head()
    df.tail()
    ```

4. Now let's actually get our hands dirty and start working on this. To start we will clone the needed files from GitHub. Open up a terminal window and execute the following commands:

```bash
      mkdir pandas-lab-devnet
      cd pandas-lab-devnet
      git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/security-pandas-assets.git
      cd security-pandas-assets
```

5. Open up your favorite code editor and open the `pandas_exercise.py` file that you have just cloned. In here there are many pre-written functions that are going to help us analyze the data. 

6. To execute the above described code, please uncomment these lines in the main function by deleting the `#TODO `:

```python
      def main():
      # Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
            #TODO df = obtain_df_from_dict()
            #TODO print(df.head())
            #TODO print(df.tail())
```

To this:

```python
      def main():
      # Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
            df = obtain_df_from_dict()
            print(df.head())
            print(df.tail())
```

7. Don't forget to save, and then hop back over to your terminal window. Here we are going to execute this Python file. First, we will create a Python virtual environment and install 2 libraries that we need for Pandas:

```bash
      python3.8 -m venv PANDAS-VENV
      source PANDAS-VENV/bin/activate
      pip install pandas
      pip install numpy
      pip install matplotlib.pylab
```

8. Now that we have got this out of the way, we are ready to execute the file:

```bash
      python pandas_exercise.py
```

9. You will see the below output, please look at it carefully:
