# Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
In the previous step, you had an introduction about the dataset and about Pandas. In this step, we are going to play around with the dataset and learn how to use Pandas.

## Objectives

In this lab you will learn how to import a dataset with Python and how to create a DataFrame using Pandas. After this lab, you should be able to:

* Import a dataset with Python
* Create a DataFrame using Python
* Inspect the DataFrame using the built-in method _head_


## Let's start with writing our code

1. First, we have to import `pandas`. It is customary to shorten pandas to pd.
      ```python
      import pandas as pd
      ```
2. Next, we have to read the file and create it into a DataFrame. Fortunately, pandas has a built-in method for reading CSV and JSON files. 

      ```python
      df = pd.read_json(abs_file_path_json) #json file
      df = pd.read_csv(abs_file_path_csv) #csv file
      ```

3. In the last step, we always inspect our DataFrame. Usually, we look at either the first or last five rows of the DataFrame. 
    ```python
    df.head()
    ```
    and we obtain the following output
    ```bash
                          Start       Duration Subject IP Address Subject Port/Protocol  ... Peer Port/Protocol                                   Peer Host Groups Peer Bytes Actions
